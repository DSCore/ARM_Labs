	//1.  Configure port D pin#12 for the appropriate alternate function output (TIM4_CH1)

	//2.  Enable the TIM4 peripheral clock

	//3.  Configure the capture/compare register1 (CCMR1) OCM1 field as “PWMmode1.”

	//4.  Configure the capture/compare enable register (CCER) CC1E field as “enabled”

	//5.  Set PSC and ARR to achieve the desired fundamental frequency.

	//6.  Set CCMR1 to achieve the desired duty cycle.

	//7.  Enable the timer by writing ‘1’ to the CEN field in Control Register 1(CR1)
